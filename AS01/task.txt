Objective:
Build a console-based Student Management System in C++ using concepts from Weeks 1â€“3, including data types, arrays, sets, hash maps, functions, and recursion.

What to Do:
Implement a program that:

Defines a struct Student with:

int id
string name
int age
float grade
Stores student records using:

An array (static or dynamic)
A set to prevent duplicate IDs (optional but encouraged)
A hash map (unordered_map) for fast ID search
Implements the following functions:

void addStudent()
void displayAllStudents()
void findStudentByID(int id)
void deleteStudentByID(int id)
float getAverageGrade() (pass-by-reference for data array)
int factorial(int n) (recursive function)

Sample Test Case:
Add 3 students.
Display all students.
Search for a student by ID.
Delete a student.
Calculate average grade.
Calculate factorial of a number (e.g., 5).

What to Submit:
student_mgmt.cpp file
Screenshot(s) of the console output
(Optional) Short report explaining:
Data structures used
Functionality breakdown
What you learned

Tips:
Use std::vector instead of C-style arrays if preferred.
Refer to documentation for unordered_map, set, and sizeof().
Keep your code clean and well-commented.
Bonus points for creative UI or features!
